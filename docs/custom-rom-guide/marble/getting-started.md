## Processor Compatibility

:::details Qualcomm Snapdragon <Badge type="tip">QCOM</Badge>
Devices with Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets generally have better compatibility and support for bootloader unlocking. If the manufacturer doesn't allow you to unlock the bootloader of your device, there are very few chances you're going to be able to do so any time soon\
(for example, Samsung US Snapdragon carrier-locked devices cannot be unlocked without paying money for exploits).
:::

:::details MediaTek <Badge type="tip">MTK</Badge>
Mediatek devices can be bootloader-unlocked by using the official tools the manufacturer provides or by using exploits, such as [MTKClient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient).
:::

**Redmi Note 12 Turbo/Poco F5 is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor.**

## Choosing Custom ROM
When choosing a Custom ROM, prioritize features that match your preferences. ROMs range from providing a clean, stock Android experience with minimal bloatware to offering extensive customization options for themes, icons, and performance. Consider if you value a pure Android experience or a heavily customized one to find the ROM that best suits your needs. 

**With your chosen ROM in hand, let's get your device ready for the installation process.**
